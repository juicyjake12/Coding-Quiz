# Module-4-Quiz

My project is a coding quiz game, I built this quiz so that i could practice my coding knowledge and to challenege myself to make something a little more difficult to make. When you first enter the website you ar greeted by a play button and highscores button once you click play a series of multiple  choice will appear adn a new question will appear when you click the button. once you finished the game it will take you to the highscores page where you will enter your name and save and your name will be added to the leaderboard and from there you can choose to replay the game.
